Big-Data-Analytics
==================
The Reduce Side Join project shows Java code to perform an inner join on two tables. The tables are also included.

The Relative Frequency project is divided into two parts, the Pairs approach and the Stripes approach. The out put is actually the bigram probabilities of the respective input texts. I modified the Java code so that instead of assigning a count of one to the left and right neighbor of each word, I only consider the right neighbor.
